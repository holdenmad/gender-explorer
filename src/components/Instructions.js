            <p>For each slider, take a few seconds and think
             about yourself and how this continuum jives with you.
             At the end, we'll give you a few genders/sexualities 
             that you might identify with! :D </p>
             <p><strong>IMPORTANT:</strong> If you don't identify with any of the
             terms given, don't stress or feel bad. Gender's a big
             lovely soup! This is just to give you some ideas and open
             your mind to the literally infinite possibilities.</p>
