## About

This app is an educational tool to encourage you to explorer your own gender and sexuality, and spark your curiosity. In the app, the user plays with various sliders corresponding to spectrums of gender and sexuality, and receives various possibilities of what their gender could be, with some supporting information, descriptions, and resources. 

The tool is not meant to be a comprehensive list of genders and sexualities, rather an invitation to think of gender and sexuality in a new way.
